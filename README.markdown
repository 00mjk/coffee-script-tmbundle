# Textmate Bundle for Coffee-Script

This is a first attempt to provide a complete textmate bundle for CoffeeScript, an awesome mini language that compiles into clean Javascript.

Currently, the available features on the bundle are :

- Snippets for conditional statements, loops, comprehensions, functions and classes.
- Language syntax (includes embedded code)

You see there isn't much for now, but already enough to make your everyday programming a real fun.

## Installation

Assuming your textmate installation is standard, so that your bundles are installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Textmate/bundles`, you can clone the repo and use it right away by doing :

    $ cd path/to/the/cloned/repos
    $ ln -fs `pwd` ~/Library/Application\ Support/Textmate/bundles/
